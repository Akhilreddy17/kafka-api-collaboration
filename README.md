## 6.1 What's in the .gitignore?  What is this used for? 



## 6.2 Review the pom.xml file.  Did the video help explain the pom.xml?  What questions do you have? Post them to the discussion forum.



## 6.3 Where is the Java source code? (Hint: refer to the Maven standard file structure above).



## 6.4 Explore the simple code. You can ignore the partition code (or explore it, too if you like!) 



## 6.5 How many simple consumer apps are there?



## 6.6 How many simple producer apps are there?



## 6.7 What is the name of each application class?  (Hint: one is Consumer)



## 6.8 What is the fully qualified name for each application class? (Hint: one is com.spnotes.kafka.simple.Consumer)



## 6.9 Where does Java code begin execution? (Hint: public static void main()). 



## 6.10 Find the main() method for each application.  What else is in the class?



## 6.11 What dependencies are imported? What organization wrote each class you import?
