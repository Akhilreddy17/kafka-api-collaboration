# Process - Part 7 - Start the Services

## 7.1 Start a Zookeeper service. Keep the window open. What is the command? What directory must you be in to run this command as provided? Why?

Ans:
Command to start the Zookeeper service:
```
zkserver
```
We can run this command from any directory

Why, because we added the %ZOOKEEPER_HOME%\bin Â to path variable in environment variables so that executable code of Zookeeper service is available from anywhere in the laptop


## 7.2 Start a Kafka service. Keep the window open. What is the command? What directory must you be in to run this command as provided? Why?

Ans:
Command:
 .\kafka-server-start.bat .\server.properties
 Directory must use: C:\kafka_2.12-2.4.1\bin\windows folder
 We should go to this directory to start the Kafka service because bin also contains executable code
